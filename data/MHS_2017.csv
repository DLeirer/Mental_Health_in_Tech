My anxiety was going crazy because I felt like I was letting everyone down, and that was making it harder and harder to come into the office.  Earlier in the year, a new 'no working from home' policy was brought in by the company owner, and so I felt like I had to stay and keep trying, despite not getting any progress made.  Eventually after discussing a plan of attack with my project manager, I met with HR and requested a few accommodations.  Specifically, a little more flexibility in hours and location of work.  If my anxiety was making working from the office impossible, I wanted to be able to go home, regroup for a couple hours, and make up that time later in the day / week.  HR and my manager were understanding and allowed this to occur.  There was a little followup from time to time just to ensure things weren't getting worse and that I wasn't taking advantage of the situation. Additionally, between the Project Manager and my manager, we ensured there weren't too many tickets assigned in my backlog as well, to reduce the sense of an unending series of tasks piling up.",Maybe,1,"Just identified that I knew I was going through a phase of depression, and that I appreciated that they were reacting kindly despite my terrible attitude",0,,6,6,Yes,Yes,"Anxiety Disorder (Generalized, Social, Phobia, etc)","Mood Disorder (Depression, Bipolar Disorder, etc)",,"Eating Disorder (Anorexia, Bulimia, etc)",,,,,,,,,,Possibly,1,Yes,Rarely,Often,N/A,7,Maybe,No,0,,,6,Maybe/Not sure,"Yes, I experienced",2,35,female,Canada,,,,Canada,
